# charging station monitor
-----
Our project is an innovative electric car charging station with integrated online payment through a service called Chapa (details to come later).

Here's how it works:

- Users pay online via Chapa to activate the charging station.
- The station dispenses electricity for the duration purchased by the user.
- We offer station owners remote tracking capabilities. This allows them to:
    - Monitor the performance of their stations located around the world.
    - See which stations generate the most revenue.
    - Identify optimal locations for future station installations.
    Station owners can access a comprehensive transaction log.
    - This log allows them to search by transaction number, revealing details like:
        - Date and time of the transaction
        - User account information
        - Transaction amount
    - With this information, station owners can investigate user complaints and determine if a transaction was successful or not. This helps them resolve issues fairly and efficiently.
This remote tracking system provides valuable insights for station owners, helping them make informed decisions about their business.

The registration page is created using Firebase, which provides authentication.When a user registers or logs in using Firebase Authentication, their credentials are verified, and a session token is generated.The session token allows the user to remain authenticated across different pages within the same browser session.When you refresh the page, the browser retains the session token, allowing you to stay logged in.
